1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT SUM(billing.amount)
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
WHERE MONTH(billing.charged_datetime) = 3
	AND YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) = 2012;

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client 
with an id of 2?

SELECT SUM(billing.amount)
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
WHERE billing.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT sites.domain_name, clients.client_id
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per 
year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT clients.client_id, COUNT(sites.site_id) as number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(sites.created_datetime) as month_created, YEAR(sites.created_datetime) as year_created
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 1
GROUP BY month_created, year_created
ORDER BY year_created ASC, MONTH(sites.created_datetime) ASC;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each 
of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name as website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, leads.registered_datetime as date_generated
FROM sites
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime between '2011/01/01' AND '2011/02/15'
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY leads.registered_datetime;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of 
leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 
to December 31, 2011?

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime between '2011/01/01' AND '2011/12/31'
GROUP BY client_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of 
leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) as month_generated
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) between 1 AND 6 AND YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
GROUP BY leads.leads_id
ORDER BY leads.registered_datetime;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of
leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011
to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second 
query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of 
leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, 
	sites.domain_name as website,
    COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, 
    DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') as date_generated
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime between '2011/01/01' AND '2011/12/31'
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id, leads.registered_datetime;

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, 
	sites.domain_name as website,
    COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id, leads.registered_datetime;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client
 for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, 
	SUM(billing.amount) as total_revenue,
    MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) as month_charge,
    YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) as year_charge
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY month_charge, year_charge
ORDER BY billing.charged_datetime;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns.
Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer
 when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client
  owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT concat_ws(" ", clients.first_name, clients.last_name) as client_name, 
	GROUP_CONCAT(" / ", sites.domain_name) as sites
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id;
